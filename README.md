This app intends to help you with your passwords, so you don't forget them. Password managers are software programs that securely store and manage 
user passwords, login information, and other sensitive data.

SUGGESTIONS TO ENHANCE SECURITY
===============================

Enhance your security by avoiding the use of exact website or service names. Instead, create suggestive names that only you can understand.
Apply the same principle to your IDs and passwords to prevent storing real information. 

For example: WebService? DIGITAL BANK >> ID? My G***** Email >> Password? The difficult one...

Consider adding asterisks (****) in place of certain characters or numbers when inputting passwords, emails, or IDs. This practice adds an 
extra layer of security, making it more challenging for others to decipher your personal data.

Remember to keep track of the coded names or patterns you use for security. Forgetting them may result in difficulty accessing your stored information.
Ensure the strength of your security by creating unique and robust master passwords. This is a crucial aspect of safeguarding sensitive data.
